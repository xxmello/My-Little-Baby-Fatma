<h1>Our Story ❤️</h1>

<p>Amr met Fatma… and the rest is magic ✨</p>
<p>From 12-12-2024, we started our amazing journey together.</p>

<p>The first day I met you was honestly the best day of my life.  
I kept trying to get closer to you, teasing you a little here and there…  
and yes, I was totally, completely smitten! 😍  
Everything about you was like the moon shining bright — your outfit, your hair, your beautiful features… everything, truly everything. 🌙✨</p>

<p>And I’ll never forget how your laugh made my heart skip a beat,  
or how your little attitude kept me love you more 😂💖  
From that day on, I knew you were my everything.</p>

    const heart = document.createElement('div');
    heart.classList.add('heart');
    heart.style.left = Math.random() * window.innerWidth + 'px';
    heart.style.animationDuration = (3 + Math.random() * 3) + 's';
    document.body.appendChild(heart);
    setTimeout(() => heart.remove(), 6000);
}

// Create a heart every 500ms
setInterval(createHeart, 500);
